# University Math

This is where I will post any code that I create for demos in my university math courses.

You can run them here: https://repl.it/new/python3

If you are a University of Toronto student, then you have access to a Jupyter Notebook server, and can instead run them here: https://utoronto.syzygy.ca/

## 1. Integral Caluclus (MAT136)

### 1.1 ```Riemann_sums.py```

This code computes Riemann sums for x^2.
